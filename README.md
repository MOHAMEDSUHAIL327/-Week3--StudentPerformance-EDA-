1. Load the COVID-19 dataset using pandas and display the first few rows.
2. Clean the data by handling missing values and keeping only relevant columns.
3. Convert the `date` column to proper datetime format.
4. Identify the top 10 countries with the highest total COVID-19 cases.
5. Visualize new case trends over time for selected countries (e.g., India, US, Brazil).
6. Create a bar chart comparing total deaths among top affected countries.
7. Group the data by date to observe global growth trends in cases and deaths.
8. Generate a line plot showing Indiaâ€™s total case growth over time.
9. Calculate the death rate using the formula `(total_deaths / total_cases) * 100`.
10. Present clear visualizations and insights using matplotlib and seaborn.
